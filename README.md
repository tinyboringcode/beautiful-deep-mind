# Beautiful Deep Mind (BDM)

A neural network model whose goal is to discover how consciousness works and create an algorithm that learns like the human brain, i.e. based on patterns. The goal of this project is to reduce the energy requirement for training the ML model. And also creating something amazing. ðŸš€ðŸ¤ 

## Tensor using

<code>
tensor = Tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) 
# Tensor(shape=[2, 2], data=[[1, 2], [3, 4]], rank=2)

tensor.shape 
#[2,2]

tensor.data 
#[[1,2], [3,4]]

tensor.rank 
#2
</code>
